## A pain medication helper app built in React Native

Morphium helps you keep track of when you are allowed to take medication that has a limit on its frequency. Most medication apps remind you that you **need** to take something - Morphium will help you keep track of when you are _allowed_ to take pain relief.

Set the name of your medication, and the minimum interval that you have been advised or prescribed by your doctor. When you press start, the app will count down that time for you. It keeps track of it even if you turn your phone off or cross into a different time zone.

This app does not give medical advice! Always follow the instructions that were given to you by your doctor.
